# P-and-G-Heater-IOT-Workshop

In this project I created a simple IOT system that consists of:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Temperature Sensor
3. Android Application that collects the sensor readings and sends data to the Arduino.
4. Bluetooth module

First, you click the "+" button to choose your bluetooth module to be connected with the arduino.
then, when the connection is successful, you can press the "Calculate Waiting Time" button to start calculating the remaining time for the heater to reach the desired temperature.
and this happens when the temperature sesonr takes the current temperature value of the water and then the arduino makes some calculations to calculate the remaining time.
and finally the remaining time will appear at the bottom of the screen.
